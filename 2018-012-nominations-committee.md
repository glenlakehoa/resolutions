WHEREAS, the Board believes it is in the best interest of the Association to establish, pursuant to the governing documents of the Association, an Ad Hoc Nominations Committee charged with the organization and execution of the election of the Board of Directors at the Association’s Annual Meeting typically held in early February;

NOW THEREFORE, THE BOARD HEREBY RESOLVES THAT AN AD HOC NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE SHALL BE DESIGNATED AND OPERATE AS FOLLOWS:

1. Purposes of the Nominations Committee: The specific purposes for which the Nominations Committee is formed are to:
     a. Review the prior year’s nominations and election process and revise where needed. The nominations and election process shall be presented to the Board during the October meeting of the Board of Directors.
     a. Prepare a timeline for the election process, including the nomination period, a minimum of two (2) candidate town hall meetings, the sending and receiving of ballots to and from Association voters, and the Annual Meeting itself. The timeline shall be presented to the Board during the October meeting of the Board of Directors.
     a. Prepare for Board approval all documents pertaining to the nominations and elections, including, but not limited to: nomination letters; nomination forms; website forms; town hall questionnaires; ballots and ballot letters; and proxy forms. Documents shall be approved by the Board of Directors at times appropriate to the timeline prepared in Section 1(b). Approvals can be conducted via e-mail, telephone, or in-person meetings.
     a. Organize a minimum of two (2) town hall meetings where candidates can present themselves to the voters and can answer questions pertaining to their vision of the future of the Association. In the case of prepared questions, these questions and relevant documents should be sent to the candidates in time for them to prepare appropriately.
     a. Prepare a ballot form that will accommodate voting for the candidates for Board of Director positions and voting on several amendments to the Association’s governing documents. These amendments will be communicated by the Board of Directors. f) The Association’s governing documents offer the option of candidates nominating themselves at the Annual Meeting. Prepare a process and the required documents to accommodate floor nominees, including new ballot forms and proxy form retractions.
     a. Organize the counting of the votes by a group of impartial counters at the Annual Meeting. Votes shall be counted at least three (3) times and consistent results shall be presented at the Annual Meeting.
     a. Work together with Board to organize the Annual Meeting. Prepare a budget proposal for the Annual Meeting and the election process.

2. Constraints on the Nominations Committee: The above-mentioned purposes for which the Nominations Committee is formed are subject to the following constraints:
a) The Committee members and the Committee Chair shall be appointed by the Board and shall serve at the pleasure of the Board until the Committee is dissolved. A liaison member of the Board will be assigned to the Committee.
b) The Nominations Committee may not enter into contracts independently of the Association because the Committee is not a legal entity separate from the Association. All contracts must be approved by the Board as a contract with the Association.
c) Small expenditures such as (but not limited to) printing of signs, informal mailings, snacks and drinks for consumption at the Annual Meeting shall be subject to approval by the President of the Board of Directors.

These regular Committee meetings are not open to other members of the Association.
e) Meetings may be in person or by conference call, as determined by the Chair.
f) Minutes from each Committee meeting are not required.
g) The Committee Chair, or a designee, shall present a Committee Report to the Board on its activities and any recommendations on an as needed basis.

4. Dissolution of the Nominations Committee: Once the purpose and responsibilities of the Committee are completed for the current year, and no other tasks have been added by the Board, the Committee shall be dissolved by order of the Board.

The Board reserves the right to modify this Resolution at any time in its sole discretion.

The undersigned, being the Board of Directors (hereafter referred to as the "Board") of the Glenlake Upstate Homeowners Association, Inc. (hereafter referred to as the "Association"), do hereby resolve that:

WHEREAS, Article V of the Bylaws of the Association authorizes the Board to establish by Board Resolution certain committees and to establish the rules and governance of those committees; and

WHEREAS, the Board believes it is in the best interest of the Association to establish, pursuant to the governing documents of the Association, a Standing Patio Homes Committee charged with assisting the Board in managing the affairs specific to the patio homes;

NOW, THEREFORE, THE BOARD HEREBY RESOLVES THAT A STANDING PATIO HOMES COMMITTEE SHALL BE DESIGNATED AND OPERATE AS FOLLOWS:

## Purposes of the Patio Homes Committee:

The specific purposes for which the Patio Homes Committee is formed are to
  <ol type="a">
  <li>On an annual basis and operating within any existing landscaping and management contracts, determine the monthly assessment for grounds maintenance to be charged to each lot owner in the Patio Homes Neighborhood and make such recommendation to the Board.</li>
  <li>When determining the above monthly assessment, always seek to maintain a positive balance and a reasonable surplus in the Patio Homes' account.</li>
  <li>Consider any other matters which may arise that are specific to the Patio Home Neighborhood and, as necessary, make appropriate recommendations concerning them to the Board.</li>
  </ol>
  
## Constraints on the Patio Homes Committee:

The above-mentioned purposes for which the Patio Homes Committee is formed are subject to the following constraints:
<ol type="a">
  <li>The Committee members and the Committee Chair shall be appointed by the Board and shall serve at the pleasure of the Board for a term of one year. A Liaison member of the Board will be assigned to the Committee.</li>
  <li>The Patio Homes Committee may not enter into contracts independently of the Association because neither the Patio Homes Neighborhood nor the Committee is a legal entity separate from the Association. All contracts must be approved by the Board as a contract with the Association.</li>
  <li>The Committee Chair may not make purchases for Committee purposes without prior Board approval.</li>
  <li>Meetings may be in person or by conference call, as determined by the Chair, but the Committee should meet in person at least quarterly. A quorum-a simple majority of Committee members, not including the Liaison-must be present to conduct Committee business. The Liaison will attend meetings in a non-voting capacity unless his or her vote is required to break a tie. These meetings are not open to other Association members.</li>
  <li>Minutes from each Committee meeting are not required.</li>
  <li>The Committee Chair, or a designee, shall present a Committee Report to the Board summarizing its activities and recommendations on an as needed basis.</li>
</ol>

The Board reserves the right to modify this Resolution at any time in its sole discretion. The signatures of all Board members passing this Resolution appear below.

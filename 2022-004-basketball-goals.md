## Article 2. Modular basketball goals
<ol type="a">
  <li>Modular basketball goals are goals having a base with a capacity of at least 30 gallons filled with sand or water and a backboard that is clear and at least 48 inches wide. The base must be fully filled when the modular hoop is in use. Sand is strongly encouraged as base filler as it provides better stability than water. The placing of heavy materials on top of the base, e.g. sandbags or cinder blocks, to improve stability is unsightly and will not be allowed.</li>
  <li>Modular basketball goals are considered play equipment under Article 8.33 of the Declaration and not intended to be permanent or semi-permanent.</li>
  <li>Modular goals must be used in the owner's backyard or owner's property and placed so that play does not extend onto neighbors' properties, or create an obstacle to common areas sidewalks, or street. </li>
  <li>Modular basketball goals may be used on driveways. However, modular basketball goals must be removed from front lot area and returned to the back lot area out of sight of the street if not in use. The presence of a sloping driveway does not waive or limit this restriction.</li>
  <li>Modular basketball goals, like any other exterior change, are subject to advance written approval of the Architectural Review Committee.</li>
</ol>

## Article 3. Use rules
<ol type="a">
  <li>Basketball goals that are visible from the street or from the neighbor's yards must be mechanically sound, clean, and well maintained. The net must always be intact. Owners may not permit visible Basketball goals to become an unsafe or unsightly nuisance. The Board, in its sole judgment, may require the removal of such basketball goal, including the use of self-help.</li>
  <li>For safety reasons, basketball goals must be placed to avoid balls striking vehicles, fragile plants or other items on adjacent properties. The homeowner will be held liable for any damages caused during the use, operation, installation or re-location of the basketball goal.</li>

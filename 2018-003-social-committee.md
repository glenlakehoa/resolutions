The undersigned, being the Board of Directors (hereafter referred to as the “Board”) of the Glenlake Upstate Homeowners Association, Inc. (hereafter referred to as the “Association”), do hereby resolve that:

WHEREAS, Article V of the Bylaws of the Association authorizes the Board to establish by Board Resolution certain committees and to establish the rules and governance of those committees; and

WHEREAS, the Board believes it is in the best interest of the Association to establish, pursuant to the governing documents of the Association, a Standing Social Committee charged with creating and planning several social functions that will help bring the neighborhood together and allow for
more interaction and better communication between neighbors.

NOW THEREFORE, THE BOARD HEREBY RESOLVES A STANDING SOCIAL COMMITTEE SHALL BE DESIGNATED AND OPERATE AS FOLLOWS:

1. Purposes of the Social Committee: The specific purposes for which the Social Committee is formed are to:
  a. Organize and plan social and special activities that will benefit the residents of the Association.
  a. Welcome new Homeowners of the Association with information about not only Glen Lake, but also the surrounding area.
  a. Help foster good communications among neighbors.
  a. Work with the community to solicit other ideas for events.
  a. Contribute articles to the Association newsletter.
  a. Aid with the update and/or creation of budget line items and their forecasted dollar amounts related to the social activities of the Association in future annual operating budgets with the Budget Committee.

2. Constraints on the Social Committee: The above mentioned purposes for which the Social Committee is formed are subject to the following constraints:
(a) The Committee members and the Committee Chair shall be appointed by the Board and shall serve at the pleasure of the Board for a term of one year. A liaison member of the Board will be assigned to the Committee.
(b) The Social Committee may not enter into contracts independently of the Association because the Committee is not a legal entity separate from the Association. All contracts must be approved by the Board as a contract with the Association.
(c) The Board will allocate funds to the Committee during the annual budgeting process to be used for supplies and costs associated with staging community events and producing newsletters, greeting packages, and other communications.
(d) The Committee Chair may not make purchases from their allocated funds for Committee purposes in amounts larger than two hundred dollars ($200.00) without prior Board approval.
(e) The Committee may, from time to time, desire to raise additional funds for use by the Committee. As long as these fund raising strategies are legal and transparent, the Committee is free to engage in them. However, before using these funds, the Committee must turn them over to the CFO of our Management Company to be deposited in the Association account and
flagged as income generated by the Social Committee. The Committee's budget line will automatically be increased by any amount raised and deposited in the Association account.
(f) The Committee should meet in person at least once per month. A quorum must be present to conduct Committee business. A quorum for meetings shall be a majority of Committee members, not including the liaison. The liaison member of the Board will attend the meetingin a non-voting capacity unless his or her vote is required to break a tie. These regular
Committee meetings are not open to other members of the Association. 
(g) Meetings may be in person or by conference call, as determined by the Chair.
(h) Minutes from each Committee meeting are not required.
(i) The Committee Chair, or a designee, shall present a Committee Report to the Board on its activities and any recommendations on an as needed basis.

The Board reserves the right to modify this Resolution at any time in its sole discretion. In order to facilitate execution, this Resolution may be executed in multiple counterparts, which shall together constitute one original instrument. The signatures of all Board members passing this Resolution appear below.

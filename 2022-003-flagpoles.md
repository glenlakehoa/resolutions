WHEREAS it is expected that the Senate will pass the House Bill and the Governor of South Carolina will sign this Bill into Law; and

WHEREAS Title 4 of the US Code regulates proper display of the United States Flag; and

WHEREAS the Board believes that the Declaration conflicts with the current South Carolina Code and wishes to remediate such conflict by amending the Community-Wide Standard and promulgating new rules,

THE COMMUNITY-WIDE STANDARD SHALL BE AMENDED AND RULES SHALL BE PROMULGATED AS FOLLOWS:

## Article 1. Flag approval by the Architectural Review Committee
Flagpoles, without limitation residential flag poles, residential wall mount, garden and banner poles, and telescoping flag poles must be approved by the Architectural Review Committee.

## Article 2. Flagpoles
<ol type="a">
  <li>Only the flag for the United States of America and the South Carolina State flag can be flown.  No school, sport teams, political, or foreign country flags can be flown from the flag pole.</li>
  <li>The pole is to be no higher than 20 ft. for a single story and no higher than 25 ft. for a two story resident.</li>
  <li>The pole must look professionally installed according to the manufacturer’s specifications and the base landscaped to hide the pole supporting structure</li>
  <li>The halyards are to be "silenced" by using "Snap Covers" or other hardware. NOTE: These covers usually wear out every 2-3 years and need to be replaced prior to becoming a nuisance.</li>
  <li>The pole must be rated to withstand at least 50 mph winds. (Most reputable manufacturers rate their poles at 85 mph.)</li>
  <li>Flag size for a flagpole: 2 ft. x 3 ft. minimum – 3 ft. x 5 ft. maximum. NOTE: Most flag companies will set this limit due to limitations of the poles themselves. More expensive poles with thicker wall construction can handle a larger flag. Obviously, you should follow the manufacturer's recommendation.</li>
  <li>If flying the US Flag and the South Carolina State flag simultaneously, the flagpole manufacture’s specifications must indicate the pole can withstand the necessary forces to handle the two flags.</li>
  <li>The flagpole manufacture’s weblink to the pole’s specifications must be submitted as part of the request to the ARC.</li>
</ol>

## Article 3. Display
<ol type="a">
  <li>US Code Title 4 § 6 stipulates that the flag may be displayed 24 hours a day if properly illuminated during the hours of darkness. Proper illumination shall be either direct vertical up-lighting or narrow spot lighting coming from the street-side yard edge pointing towards the residence and flag, avoiding the direction of other residences.</li>
  <li>US Code Title 4 § 8 stipulates that the flag shall never be displayed with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.</li>
  <li>All stipulations in this Article and Title 4 of the US Code shall apply to the owners and residents in the Association.</li>
</ol>

## Severability
If any part, term or provision of this Resolution is held to be illegal, in conflict with any law or otherwise invalid, or revoked or amended, the remaining portion or portions shall be considered severable and not be affected by such determination, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced as if the Resolution did not contain the particular part, term or provisions held to be illegal, invalid, revoked or amended.

## Changes to the Resolution
The Board reserves the right to modify this Resolution at any time in its sole discretion by amending or revoking the Resolution after a simple majority vote.
